					<h2 class="h2">History</h2>
					<p>James Joseph Brown (May 3, 1933 / December 25, 2006) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, musician, record producer
					and bandleader. A progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th-century music and dance, he is often referred to as the
					"Godfather of Soul". In a career that lasted 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres.Brown began 
					his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He joined an R&B vocal group, the Gospel Starlighters (which later evolved 
					into the Famous Flames) founded by Bobby Byrd, in which he was the lead singer. First coming to national public attention
					in the late 1950s as a member of the singing group The Famous Flames with the hit ballads "Please, Please, Please" and "Try Me",
					Brown built a reputation as a tireless live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James 
					Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles 
					such as "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag", "I Got You (I Feel Good)" and "It's a Man's World".</p>
					
					<p>During the late 1960s,Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly "Africanized" approach to music-making 
					that influenced the development of funk music.[5] By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the 
					formation of the J.B.s with records such as "Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine" and "The Payback". He also became noted
					for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit "Say It Loud â€“ I'm Black and I'm Proud". Brown continued to perform and 
					record until his death from pneumonia in 2006. Brown was inducted into 1st class of the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in 
					2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. Brown recorded 17 singles that reached number one on the Billboard R&B charts.
					He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the Billboard Hot 100 chart which did not reach No. 1.Brown has received 
					honors from many institutions, including inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel 
					Whitburn's analysis of the Billboard R&B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in The Top 500 Artists. He is ranked No. 7
					on Rolling Stone's list of its 100 greatest artists of all time. Rolling Stone has also cited Brown as the most sampled artist of 
					all time.</p>
