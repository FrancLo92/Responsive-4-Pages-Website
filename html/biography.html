					<h2 class="h2">Music Influence.</h2>
						<p>James Brown was clearly influenced by classic blues, gospel, and African-American 
					folk music. Brown knew he wanted to become an entertainer after watching performance 
					footage of the popular jazz and R&B singer Louis Jordan. He was also certainly 
					influenced by artists like Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, and Little Richard, though these
					musical contemporaries would have been just as influenced by James Brown as he was 
					by them.</p>

					<h2 class="h2">Young James.</h2>
						<p>Long before he changed the course of 20th-century popular music and crowned himself 
					“The Hardest Working Man in Show Business,” little James Brown may well have been the 
					hardest working boy in Augusta, Georgia, where he was sent to live with his Aunt Honey 
					Washington at the age of six. He’d spent the previous several years with his father, 
					James, Sr., who scraped out a meager living selling pine tar to the local turpentine 
					factory in the woods of Barnwell County, South Carolina, just down the Savannah River 
					from Augusta. James’s mother had left with another man when James was only four, and 
					while Aunt Honey would play something of a maternal role for James, the fact that she 
					ran a brothel and sold moonshine for a living made for anything but a traditional upbringing.
					While other famous musicians of his generation would get their musical training in the traditional
					context of the church, James Brown would get his on the streets, where between jobs as a 
					cotton-picker, coal-scrounger and shoeshine boy, he also danced and sang to attract clients
					to his aunt’s place of business. He honed his talents further in prison, where he was sentenced
					to serve 8-to-16 years for stealing from parked cars at the age of 15. An experience that
					might have broken another man, however, instead inspired Brown to dedicate himself to music.
					He did his first gospel singing while in prison, where he earned the nickname “Music Box” 
					and impressed his warden and the Georgia State Parole Board enough with his seriousness of 
					purpose to win his release after only three years. At the age of 19, a highly motivated, 
					worldly wise and ferociously talented James Brown walked out of prison and began his climb 
					toward music greatness.</p>
